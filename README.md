- I have been programming all my life, started with Java and C++, but grew into other langauges. My stong suites is .NET C# with
  other .NET frameworks and languages like ASP.net, F# and VB.net. Node is my favorite quick setup of an API server or desktop
  app with electron. Connecting mongoDB, use bootstrap/jquery or angualar for a frontend and a nodeJS Backend all in docker... 
  now thats fun! I have a passion in artificial intelligence and machine learning with tensorflow/pyTorch/ML.net. Building
  something that can say hi back, is very fullfilling to me! Of course I am fullstack web dev, along with game development,
  desktop apps and mobile app development. Some things I have done... I have builted robots, build crypto trading bots with
  arbitrage trading, ownn mobile game apps, and many other projects. Make sure to check my github pages website and the repo's
  below! I have many open source projects!<hr/><br/>
